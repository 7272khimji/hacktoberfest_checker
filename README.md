The Hacktoberfest Checker Flutter app is my contribution for Hacktoberfest 2020.

## So, how are you contributing exactly?

Are you learning flutter? Do you want to brush up your skills and earn your HF 2020 Shirt in the meantime? Then this is the project for you!

This project was made in about 3 hours and has A LOT of rough edges that need polishing (bad code, missing documentation, bugs, etc...). Some of them were made on purpose.

With your contribution, this project can be improved to become a fully fledged mobile HF checker, so keep these PRs coming!

Flutter Packages used:
- `flutter_bloc`
- `http`
- `equatable`
- `shared_preferences`

## How to Contribute:

You will find some issues indicating the tasks that need to be done for this project to be a fully fledged app, however this is not the only way you can contribute. Each issue can be one or more PRs.

If you eyeball the code a bit you will find A LOT of rough edges. Want to fix them? Send a PR.

Simple, right?
